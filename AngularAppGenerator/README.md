# AngularAppGenerator
Generate base application code from a database.  Generates a PHP REST API and Angular services and models

This project is designed to take some of the tedium out of starting a new Angular/PHP project.
It starts with creating the application data model.  The application will read the database and some configuration files and generate a basic CRUD API in PHP.
It will also generate the Angular services and models.

All of the code is generated based on a set of templates.
